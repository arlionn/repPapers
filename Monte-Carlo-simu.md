  - We extend the simulation results in Santos Silva and Tenreyro ([2006](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/TENREYRO/jensen08k.pdf), The log of gravity, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 88, 641-658) by considering a novel data-generating process. Our results confirm that the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator is generally well behaved, even when the proportion of zeros in the sample is very large.
